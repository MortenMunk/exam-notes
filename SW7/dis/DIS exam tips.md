Start with what and why is it important
explain system model
describe one or two algorithms

**Lec 4:**

Skip crash detection


**Lec 5**:
- Discuss ISIS a little (not too much time)
	- Causal maneuver and lamport clocks
	- Describe below figure![[Pasted image 20241003142017.png]]

**Lec 6**:
- Mutex requires very good presentation
- Consensus is harder to discuss both byzantine, equivalence, f-sync-resilient, f-byzantine, etc. 

Consensus = 2 minutes about context, why it is important
	- then Equivalence, byzantine failures, impossibility results (about 4 minutes)
	- f-crashes resilient
	- f-king (brug eksempel fra tavlen)
	- Paxsos or Raft without detailed algorithm
